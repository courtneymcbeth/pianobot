# PianoBot

PianoBot is a robot that plays the piano. The version that I have constructed is suitable for use on a standard piano with 88 keys. Music is converted from a MIDI file to commands that are transmitted from a computer to an Arduino (an Arduino Mega 2560 in my case; however, other models would also work) using serial communication over bluetooth.
